## Users Guide

This guide is designed to serve as a guide to understand the Cisco catalystwan-sdk and how to use the SDK to facilitate the development of applications which ultimately provide automation for the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN solution.

The catalystwan-sdk is designed to make it easier for developers to consume the Catalyst SD-WAN Manager APIs.  It does this by providing abstractions for low-level tasks such as authentication and session management; as well implementing a data model for endpoints, so developers do not have parse JSON output to extract relevant information from returned objects.
